# APS1070 – Project 1: Basic Principles and Models

**Course:** APS1070 – Data Analytics and Machine Learning  
**Term:** Fall 2024  
**Author:** Alton Rego  
**Student ID:** 1004909307  

## 📘 Overview

This notebook explores foundational data analysis and machine learning techniques using Python. It was developed as part of Project 1 for the APS1070 course.

The objective of this project is to practice:
- Vectorized coding
- Data manipulation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization for insight generation

## 📊 Project Structure

- `analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all code, plots, and analysis.
- No external data files are included; all required data manipulation is embedded in the notebook.

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning techniques were applied:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  Utilized `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` to classify the dataset and evaluate performance.

- **Train-Test Split**  
  Used `train_test_split` to partition the dataset for training and evaluation.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Accuracy scores were calculated on training and test sets using predictions from the model.

## 🚀 How to Run

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells in order to view the analysis and results.

## 📝 Notes

- The project emphasizes academic integrity, and all work is original.
- Code is vectorized where appropriate for performance.
